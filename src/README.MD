#PerPlayerDripleaf
Tiny plugin that makes tilting of big dripleaf blocks client-side.
There are no configuration files, commands, nor permissions.

### What this plugin **can** do:

- Players stepping on big dripleaf blocks is handled "client-side" via package sending.
- Big dripleaf mechanics are pretty much identical to vanilla.
- When big dripleaf blocks are stepped on big any other entity, or are hit by projectiles, they will tilt normally for all players.

### What it **can't** do:

- It only works for players stepping on the blocks. By extension that means that it will not work for players that are mounted upon entities, like riding horses, pigs, etc.

### What is the plugin useful for?

- Parkour courses
